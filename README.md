# Plant Care

Most farmers write down the appropriate times for watering, spraying, fertilizing, and
harvesting on papers or mobile notes. This method is considered ineffective, as the farmer
may forget some of these times because there is no smart reminder mechanism, and this may
be considered as a major cause for poor production or the emergence of some plant diseases.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a mobile application that provides all farmers with
the ability to add plants to their farm and adding procedures for irrigation, spraying,
fertilizing, and harvesting for each type of plant to remind farmers of the times of watering,
spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting. Plant care makes agriculture easier for farmers by organizing their daily 
tasks and reminding them when it is time to perform a certain plant procedure.
